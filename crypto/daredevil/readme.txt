DAREDEVIL
=============================

Matt-Murdock is one my favourite 
character from marvel universe.

I found his msg signing server can you 
help me to retrive his secret.


Feel free to change if you feel it dumb description :(

CHALLENGE CONCEPT
====================================

It's a normal message signing server(RSA) vulnerable to blind attack.
Matt-Murdock from (DAREDEVIL) is a superhero who  blind in the show  which gives a clear indication to attack vector.
P.S : Again feel free to chanllenge description if you don't like
Feel free to ping if you find any loophole or bug in the code



FILE STRUCTURE 
==============================================

SERVER :- Just build the dockerfile to test it no need to provide any file to users just build it and ans add nc ip/portserver in chall description
(remotecontains the option to display encryption part of the code)
I have tested the Docker image in my local machine itt was running super fine.


src : much cleaner code than server side just to have a quick lock and run locally 
sol : solver script

If you find any loophole or any want to suggest some changes :-> contact me on
