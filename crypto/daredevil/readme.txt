Matt-Murdock from (DAREDEVIL) is a superhero who is blind in the show which gives a clear indication to attack vector.

FILE STRUCTURE 
==============

server :- Build the dockerfile to check it out, I have tested the Docker image in my local machine it was running super fine.
src :- Much cleaner code than server side just to have a quick look and run locally 
sol :- Solver script
